*   Program Name:   LLWA                                              *
*                                                                     *
*  Documentation:   This program is meant to be run as a TSO          *
*                   command, APF authorized.  This program will       *
*                   replace the four TSO authorization tables that    *
*                   are used by your TSO session:  IKJEFTE2,          *
*                   IKJEFTE8, IKJEFTAP, and IKJEFTNS, and will        *
*                   re-point the proper addresses in the LWA          *
*                   (Logon Work Area) to point to the new tables.     *
*                   The effect of the change is immediate, and        *
*                   it will only affect the invoker's TSO session.    *
*                                                                     *
*    Environment:   TSO command, APF Authorized.                      *

*       Function:   To load a completely new set of TSO authorization *
*                   tables from any load library, so they are honored *
*                   by your TSO session.  The load library has to be  *
*                   APF-authorized, and this program has to be APF-   *
*                   authorized.                                       *

*                   The tables should be present with CSECT names     *
*                   KKJEFTE2, etc. instead of IKJEFTE2, etc. because  *
*                   LOAD should find the correct copy, and not reuse  *
*                   the TSO userid's copy which is in JPA, and which  *
*                   is searched first, even using a DCB-directed      *
*                   LOAD.                                             *

*                   If the LLWAPOUT DD name is allocated (to an       *

*                   "program name list" format will be produced       *
*                   from the PARMLIB-format member, or from a         *
*                   loadlib member in the IKJTABLS load module.       *
*                   In other words, the PARMLIB-format input or       *
*                   the load module CSECTs will be converted to       *
*                   LRECL=8 program name list format.                 *
*                                                                     *
*     Conversion:   You can use the LLWA command to perform data      *
*                   conversion from either load module input, or      *
*                   PARMLIB-format input, into LRECL=8 dataset        *
*                   input.  Just allocate the input files:            *

*                   into core (from the loadlib) and measured.        *
*                   Measurement stops at the first blank entry.       *
*                   Then, 240 bytes  (30 blank entries) are           *
*                   added at the end of the E2, E8, and AP            *
*                   tables.  104 bytes (10 blank entries              *
*                   followed by X'FFFF') are added on at the end      *
*                   of the NS table.  Subpool 252 storage in Key      *
*                   0 is GETMAINed for each table, and the            *
*                   LOADed tables are copied into their               *
*                   designated GETMAIN areas.  Then the LWA           *
*                   fields are re-pointed to the new tables and       *
*                   to their sizes, so that the user's session        *
*                   will honor them immediately.  Simulation of       *
*                   a load from PARMLIB is done.  But the STEPLIB     *
*                   flags are turned on, so that a PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) *
*                   command (issued globally on the MVS instance)     *
*                   will not overlay the tables that we have          *
*                   created.                                          *

*     LLWA D  takes LRECL=8 input consisting of (up to) 4 lists
*     of program names.  The list belonging to each table is
*     defined by a header entry, which is "---E2---",
*     "---E8---", "---AP---", or "---NS---".
*
*     Output is 4 prebuilt tables in "above the 16M line
*     storage".  Depending on the limiting parms, either all
*     the 4 tables are replaced in SP-252 core, or only the one
*     selected is replaced.
*
*     Copying of the tables is via an MVCL instruction, the
*     same way IBM does it at LOGON time, in module IKJEFTP1.
*                                                                     *

*     LLWA P  takes PARMLIB-format input that looks like an
*     IKJTSOxx member.  This member is read, and is scanned
*     for names that are between AUTHCMD NAMES ( ), AUTHPGM
*     NAMES ( ), AUTHTSF NAMES( ), or NOTBKGND NAMES( ).
*     Those program names are converted into a list, in the
*     four separate categories, as they are present in the
*     IKJTSOxx-like dataset.
*
*     Output is 4 prebuilt tables in "above the 16M line
*     storage".  Depending on the limiting parms, either all
*     the 4 tables are replaced in SP-252 core, or only the

*
*     Copying of the tables is via an MVCL instruction, the

*
*     Optional LRECL=8 output can be generated in LIST format,
*     if an LLWAPOUT DD name is allocated to an LRECL=8
*     dataset, optionally.  This output can be edited later,
*     and used as input to LLWA D.
